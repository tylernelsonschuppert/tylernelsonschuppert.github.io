# Tyler Nelson-Schuppert's Portfolio Website
### https://www.tylernelsonschuppert.com/

Hello, my name is Tyler Nelson-Schuppert.  If you are a human reading this - thank you for taking the time to look at the README file for my GitHub Repository.  This GitHub repository manages the code used for my professional portfolio website.  The focus of this website is to feature a publicly viewable forum marketing my resume and projects to potential employers and colleagues.

This website was hand-coded by me while participating in a Front-End Web Development boot-camp based in Louisville, KY hosted by an organization named "Code Lousville".  This GitHub Repository (and the associated Website) are being submitted by me to Code Louisville to fulfill project-specific requirements for completion of the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development program.

One of the requirements for the project is to include a README (this README) in the respective GitHub repository detailing fullfillment of all project feature requirements.  I will acknowledge and elaborate on fullfilment of the project requirements (as specified by the Front-End Development Project Requirements document) below:

>Choose a minimum of 3 of the below features and incorporate into your site.

The 3 features I have chosen as well as an explanation for the implementation of each feature are as follows:

> A navigation menu that collapses into a “hamburger” expandable menu on mobile devices and is fully displayed on a desktop-size screen
- (Testing nested list item markdown)


> Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it
- (Testing nested list item markdown)


> Import Bootstrap from a CDN and use its column system to create a responsive design
- (Testing nested list item markdown)


(Initial commit to review README markdown styling, README document to be updated and ammended further in the future)
